# Notepad-- (NotepadCS)

A text editor with a lot of useless features.

Made for fun, and to learn.

## Stack
- Language: C# 9.0
- Environment: .NET 6
- Framework: WinForms

## Support
*Notepad--* will only work on Windows.

This is because I made the great decision of using WinForms since I'm lazy and don't want to learn WPF.

## Features

All features that come with the builtin Windows Notepad, but with:

- Editing Timer (see how long you've been editing a file)
